# Instagram Like Button Feature

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the like button feature similar to Instagram using JavaScript.

## Overview

In this project, we've created a like button feature similar to what you would find in Instagram. When the user clicks the like button, the button's appearance changes to indicate that the post has been liked. Clicking the button again removes the like.

## Features

- Like Button: Clicking the like button toggles between liked and unliked states.
- Visual Feedback: The button changes its appearance (e.g., color, icon) to provide visual feedback to the user.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the like button and providing visual feedback.
- JavaScript: Used to implement the functionality of the like button.
