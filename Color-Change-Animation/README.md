This project demonstrates a simple JavaScript animation where the color of an object changes gradually from black at the center to a different color towards the edges.

How it Works
The animation is achieved using JavaScript to manipulate the object's color gradient dynamically. By modifying the color stops in a linear gradient, the appearance of the color change from the center to the edges is achieved.

```
