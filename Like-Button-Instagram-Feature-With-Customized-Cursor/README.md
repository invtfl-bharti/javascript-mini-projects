## Features

- **Like Button**: Mimics Instagram's like button functionality where users can click to toggle the like status of an item.
- **Customized Cursor**: Enhances user interaction by providing a customized cursor effect when hovering over the like button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How it Works

The "like" button functionality is implemented using JavaScript event listeners. When the button is clicked, it toggles between the "liked" and "unliked" states. The appearance of the button changes accordingly to provide visual feedback to the user.

The customized cursor effect is achieved by listening to mouse movement events and updating the cursor's position to follow the user's mouse. Additionally, a custom cursor image is used to replace the default cursor, enhancing the visual appeal.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-like-button.git
