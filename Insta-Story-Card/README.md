# Instagram Story Feature with JavaScript

Welcome to my Instagram story feature project! In this project, I've implemented a simple Instagram-like story feature using JavaScript. When the user clicks on a profile picture (display picture or DP), a story pops up, showcasing my knowledge of JavaScript and web development.
